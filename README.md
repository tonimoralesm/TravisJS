##TravisJS##

__TravisJS__ is a(nother) NodeJS GIS Server.

The main idea is to build a functional WFS GIS Server with NodeJS technology.

It will be based on the [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) library (for WFS handling) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) (as geodatabase).

#### Important note ####
This project is Just For Fun. It's only an excuse for me to learn NodeJS, Git and MongoDB.
